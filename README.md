This is the code for XODUS on XBOX One, which microsoft stated is not good enough for you because it rocked

It is as well shit, but I'm sharing it to show what the app did. It does nothing illegal, was just a web browser. Snipped some ads out, et all but whatever.

I hope you kids can make the XBOX One an Open Platform. Fuck microsoft's Movies+TV Initiative, it's the only reason this app was taken from you. That, and a VP at MSFT who couldn't recognize he fucking sucked and had to pick on an indie dev.

As usual, code is shit. Don't ever do this in production.
